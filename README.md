#PortfolioBalancer

A tool used to balance an ETF portfolio.  The tool takes in an ETF symbol, the number of units of the ETF held, market price per unit, purchase price per unit, target allocation percentage of the ETF for the portfolio, and the amount to contribute and will calculate the amount of units to purchase (or sell, if the amount to contribute is negative) for a balanced portfolio according to the target allocation percentage.
